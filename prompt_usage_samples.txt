"""
## 🏗 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES (Instructional Files)

1. **Follow `TEMPLATE_v10` exactly.**  
   - Do not reorder or omit sections.  
   - Keep headings and emojis exactly as defined.  

2. **Mental-Model-First Approach.**  
   - Use vivid analogies, diagrams, invariants, state explanations.  
   - Emphasize mechanical reasoning and pattern recognition.  

3. **No Code by Default.**  
   - Explain logic, states, and transformations in natural language.  
   - Only use **minimal C#** snippets if absolutely necessary (logic clarity).  
   - Never use Python, Java, C++, or pseudo-code disguised as other languages.  

4. **No LaTeX.**  
   - Use plain text math: `O(n log n)`, `n²`, `(n choose k)`.  
   - Do not include `$...$`, `\[...\]`, or LaTeX-like formatting.  

5. **Visual & Structural Requirements.**  
   - ≥1 concept summary/comparison table [relevant Sections].  
   - ≥1 complexity table (Section 5).  
   - ≥2-3 visuals (ASCII diagrams, trace tables, or simple Mermaid flows).  
   - Integrate diagrams and tables naturally (not as afterthoughts).  

6. **Mandatory Blocks.**  
   - 11 core sections (The Why → The What → … → Retention Hook).  
   - 🧩 Cognitive Lenses block (5 lenses).  
   - ⚔ Supplementary Outcomes block (practice problems, interview Q&A, misconceptions, advanced concepts, external resources).  

7. **Coverage Requirements.**  
   - Section 2 must list ALL core concepts/variations/operations for that topic day.  
   - Section 6 must name 5-10 specific real systems (OS, DB, network, applications, cloud).  
   - Practice problems: 8-10 (real sources, no solutions).  
   - Interview questions: 6+ with follow-ups (no solutions).  
   - Misconceptions: 3-5 (with stated misconceptions, why plausible, correction, memory aid, impact).  
   - Advanced concepts: 3-5.  
   - External resources: 3-5.  

8. **Word Count Target.**  
   - 7,500-15,000 words per instructional file.  
   - No per-section quotas; use as much space as needed for clarity and depth.
"""

also refer this updated context
"""
1. avoid topic/concept related short names or abbreviations
2. keep clarity of topics in mind, use easily understandable languages whenever possible
3. try to use visual representation (Graphs, charts, flow diagram, sequence diagrams, ASCII diagrams, trace tables, or simple Mermaid flows) to explain concepts/topics rather than explaining with words, whenever it is possible, helps in understanding and remembering.
4. use mermaid diagrams or ASCII diagrams fro visual representation, use best one which is suitable
5. while generating files use file name as per conventions for example **Week_01_Day_1_RAM_Model_And_Pointers_Instructional.md**.
6. Update context to always provide output as downloadable md file.
7. For mermaid diagrams, use modern mermaid context and correct code , verify rendering
8. strictly **No LaTeX.** symbols or codes, keep things with markdown compatible

------- csharp support file prompt

**Prompt context**:
- use **CONSOLIDATED_CSHARP_EXTENDED_SUPPORT_MASTER_PROMPT_v13.md** file as starting point, 
- use **SYSTEM_PROMPT_v13_EXTENDED_SUPPORT_CSHARP.md** and **SYSTEM_PROMPT_v12_EXTENDED_SUPPORT_CSHARP.md** files as reference
- use **COMPLETE_SYLLABUS_v13_FINAL.md** file for syllabus,
- use MASTER_PROMPT_v12_FINAL.md and SYSTEM_CONFIG_v12_FINAL.md files for context and system config and file naming convention.
- use **Generic_AI_Self_Check_Correction_Step.md** file for error check in generated content and self error correction context

**Action** :
- generate week 07 Csharp extended support md file, have detailed and structured content for generated file, dont skip any subsection or sub topic. cover topics in detailed.
- strictly follow template structure and file naming convention as per context
- Apply GENERIC AI SELF-CHECK & CORRECTION STEP before output (use **Generic_AI_Self_Check_Correction_Step.md** file):
  1. Verify all references (items, values, indices) exist in problem
  2. Verify logic flow (each step follows logically from previous)
  3. Verify numbers (totals cumulative, counts match actual items)
  4. Verify state consistency (changes tracked, transitions explained)
  5. Verify termination (algorithm stops at correct condition)
  6. Check 7 red flags (input mismatch, logic jump, math error, etc.)
  7. If any issue found → Fix using templates before output
  8. When all checks pass → Generate markdown file
