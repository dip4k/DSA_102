# 📚 DSA Master Curriculum v12
## **Narrative-First, Interview-Ready, Production-Grade**

**Version:** 12.1 (Rev 4, Syllabus-Synced)  
**Status:** ✅ Complete, MIT-Level Depth, v12.1 Syllabus-Aligned  
**License:** 📜 MIT (Free for learning and teaching)

---

## 🎯 What This Is

This is a **comprehensive, narrative-driven Data Structures and Algorithms curriculum** designed to transform you from foundational understanding (RAM model, Big-O, recursion) to mastery (advanced patterns, systems design, production-grade code, interview readiness) over **19 weeks**.

It preserves the **structure, tone, and visual style** of the original v12 README, while updating the **phase, week, and day-by-day syllabus** to match `COMPLETE_SYLLABUS_v12_FINAL_Updated.md` (v12.1).

### 🧠 Core Philosophy

- 🎓 **Mental Models First** — Understand *why* before *how*. Systems-level thinking precedes code.
- 📖 **Narrative-Driven** — Reads like MIT lecture notes from a master teacher, not a reference manual checklist.
- ⚙️ **Systems-Grounded** — Every concept connects to **real production systems** (Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, Redis, Netflix engineering).
- 🎨 **Pattern-Centric** — 95+ topics organized as **learnable, reusable patterns** across interview problems.
- 🎯 **Interview-Ready** — ~**98% coverage** of real FAANG-style technical interview question patterns.
- 💻 **Production-Grade Code** — C# implementations with professional quality, not LeetCode spaghetti.
- 🌐 **Visual + Interactive** — 30+ ASCII diagrams per week + dedicated visual playbooks and external visualization tools.

## ✨ Why This Curriculum Is Different

### ❌ Traditional Approach (Memorization)
- Grind 100–500 LeetCode problems
- Study algorithms in isolation, disconnected from systems
- Learn code templates without understanding invariants or trade-offs
- Hope interview questions match what you practiced
- Fight against forgetting (high cognitive load, low retention)

### ✅ v12 Approach (Understanding)
- Build **mental models** of how data structures live in memory
- Understand **why** some algorithms are faster (cache behavior, locality, CPU physics)
- Learn **patterns** that appear across 100+ problems (two-pointer, window, DP families, graph templates)
- See **real systems** (Linux, PostgreSQL, Redis, search engines) using these ideas
- Walk into interviews confident you can solve **new variants**, not just memorize old ones
- Retain knowledge via narrative flow, spaced repetition, and multi-angle explanations

### 🛠️ Five Core Competencies You Build

1. **🖥️ Hardware Intuition**  
   Understand cache lines, virtual memory, TLB, page faults, pointer chasing, CPU pipelines, SIMD. Know why contiguous arrays often beat pointer-heavy structures.

2. **📊 Complexity Mastery**  
   Analyze time and space complexity, prove bounds with recurrences, recognize amortized behavior, and know when Big-O hides important constants.

3. 🔍 **Pattern Recognition**  
   Spot the same algorithmic ideas across many problems: two-pointer, sliding windows, monotonic stack, BFS/DFS, subset DP, flows, etc.

4. ⚖️ **Trade-off Thinking**  
   Choose between arrays vs linked lists, hash tables vs balanced trees, heap vs sort, greedy vs DP, recursion vs iteration. Explain trade-offs clearly.

5. 🏭 **Systems Perspective**  
   Connect DSA to real production engineering: indexes in databases, schedulers, caches, graph engines, search, load balancing, etc.
