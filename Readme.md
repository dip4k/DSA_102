**Status:** ✅ Complete, MIT-Level Depth, Syllabus-Aligned  
**License:** 📜 MIT (Free for learning and teaching)  

---

## 🎯 What This Is

This is a **comprehensive, narrative-driven Data Structures and Algorithms curriculum** designed to transform you from foundational understanding (RAM model, Big-O, recursion) to mastery (advanced patterns, systems design, production-grade code, interview readiness) over 19 weeks.

### 🧠 Core Philosophy

- 🎓 **Mental Models First** — Understand *why* before *how*. Systems-level thinking precedes code.
- 📖 **Narrative-Driven** — Reads like MIT lecture notes from a master teacher, not a reference manual checklist.
- ⚙️ **Systems-Grounded** — Every concept connected to **real production systems** (Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, Redis, Netflix engineering).
- 🎨 **Pattern-Centric** — 95+ topics organized as **learnable, reusable patterns** across interview problems.
- 🎯 **Interview-Ready** — **98% coverage** of real FAANG technical interview questions.
- 💻 **Production-Grade Code** — C# implementations with professional quality, not LeetCode spaghetti.
- 🌐 **Visual + Interactive** — 30+ ASCII diagrams per week + embedded web visualization tools.

## ✨ Why This Curriculum Is Different

### ❌ Traditional Approach (Memorization)
- Grind 100 LeetCode problems
- Study algorithms in isolation, disconnected
- Learn code patterns without understanding trade-offs
- Hope interview questions match what you practiced
- Fight against forgetting (high cognitive load)

### ✅ v12 Approach (Understanding)
- Build **mental models** of how data structures work in memory
- Understand **why** certain algorithms are faster than others (cache behavior, locality, CPU physics)
- Learn **patterns** that appear across 100+ problems (two-pointer, divide-conquer, memoization)
- Know the **real systems** (Linux, PostgreSQL, Redis) that use these concepts
- Walk into interviews **confident you can solve *any* variant**
- Retain knowledge through narrative flow and spaced repetition

### 🛠️ Five Core Competencies You Build

1. **🖥️ Hardware Intuition**  
   Understand cache lines (64 bytes), virtual memory, TLB, page faults, pointer chasing, CPU pipeline, SIMD. Know why contiguous memory is 10-100x faster than scattered pointers.

2. **📊 Complexity Mastery**  
   Analyze any algorithm's time and space cost instantly. Prove it via recurrence trees. Understand amortized analysis. Know when Big-O hides critical constants.

3. 🔍 **Pattern Recognition**  
   See the same algorithmic idea across different problems. Recognize two-pointer in "remove duplicates," "merge arrays," "container with most water." Transfer knowledge instantly.

4. ⚖️ **Trade-off Thinking**  
   Understand when to choose arrays vs linked lists, hash tables vs balanced trees, heap vs sorting. Know the real-world trade-offs: time vs space, flexibility vs performance, simplicity vs efficiency.

5. 🏭 **Systems Perspective**  
   Connect theory to production engineering. Understand why PostgreSQL uses B-trees for indexing, why Redis uses skip lists, why Linux kernel uses red-black trees. See algorithms as engineering solutions.

### 🧠 **Study Strategies (Research-Backed)**

#### 🎯 **Strategy 1: Mental Model First**
- ❌ Don't start by coding
- ✅ Start by understanding the idea
- 🎬 Process: Draw → Explain → Code → Optimize

#### 🧠 **Strategy 2: Active Recall**
- ❌ Don't just read solutions
- ✅ Close notes, explain from memory
- 📋 Techniques: Self-testing, Interview QA without solutions, quizzing

#### 📚 **Strategy 3: Spaced Repetition**
- ❌ Don't cram everything Sunday before
- ✅ Review concepts every 3-7 days
- 🔄 Timeline: Learn Day 1 → Review Day 3 → Review Day 7 → Review Week 3

#### 🎲 **Strategy 4: Interleaving**
- ❌ Don't master one topic, then move to next
- ✅ Mix easy and hard, combine multiple weeks' concepts
- 📋 Example: Week 15 forces integration (merging, monotonic stack, DP)

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Which week should I start with?**  
A: Foundations (Weeks 1-3) are mandatory. Jump to Week 4 only if you have limited time and understand arrays/recursion. See STARTHERE.md for guidance.

**Q: Can I skip weeks?**  
A: Weeks 1-3 are core. Weeks 4-6 are high-ROI. Weeks 7-15 build progressively. Weeks 16-18 are optional elite topics.

**Q: How long does this take?**  
A: 16-20 weeks (10-15 hrs/week) for complete mastery. 4-8 weeks (20-30 hrs/week) for interview prep. 2-4 weeks (flexible) for targeted learning.

**Q: Are there solutions to practice problems?**  
A: Instructional files contain detailed traces. Interview QA deliberately omit answers to force active thinking.

**Q: Should I code along or just read?**  
A: Both! Morning: read and understand. Afternoon: trace by hand. Evening: code from scratch.

**Q: Is this for competitive programming or interviews?**  
A: Both! Weeks 1-6 emphasize interviews. Weeks 16-18 include harder problems for competitive programming.

**Q: What's different from LeetCode/Educative/etc?**  
A: This emphasizes **mental models and systems thinking** over pattern memorization. Every concept connects to real production systems. You learn 95 principles that explain 1000 problems.
