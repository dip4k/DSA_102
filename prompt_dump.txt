Total files: 5 instructional + 5 support

generate files in multiple batches

batch 1 -> week 4.5 day 1 and 5 weekly support files
batch 2 -> week 4.5 day 2 and day 3
batch 3 -> week 4.5 day 4 and day 5

Proceed to Week 4.5 using the existing v8 references and new V9 config references 
use create file content as per set context and template and structure, dont skip section and dont compact response output

for visualisation use proper ascii diagrams and if available then only use modern mermaid code

---

generate file Week_3_Day_3_Heap_Sort_And_Variants_Instructional.md as per structure and context


Update context to generate files in batches,

generate week 4.5 day 2 instructional file, refer syllabus for exact topic details

follow Rules from system config , master prompt and template, use updated syllabus.

Quality Checklist
- Verify all 11 sections present
- Confirm cognitive lenses included
- Check emoji usage consistency (v8 style)
- Verify no LaTeX encoding

"""
## 🏗 PRIMARY DIRECTIVES (Instructional Files)

1. **Follow `TEMPLATE_v10` exactly.**  
   - Do not reorder or omit sections.  
   - Keep headings and emojis exactly as defined.  

2. **Mental-Model-First Approach.**  
   - Use vivid analogies, diagrams, invariants, state explanations.  
   - Emphasize mechanical reasoning and pattern recognition.  

3. **No Code by Default.**  
   - Explain logic, states, and transformations in natural language.  
   - Only use **minimal C#** snippets if absolutely necessary (logic clarity).  
   - Never use Python, Java, C++, or pseudo-code disguised as other languages.  

4. **No LaTeX.**  
   - Use plain text math: `O(n log n)`, `n²`, `(n choose k)`.  
   - Do not include `$...$`, `\[...\]`, or LaTeX-like formatting.  

5. **Visual & Structural Requirements.**  
   - ≥1 concept summary/comparison table [relevant Sections].  
   - ≥1 complexity table (Section 5).  
   - ≥2-3 visuals (ASCII diagrams, trace tables, or simple Mermaid flows).  
   - Integrate diagrams and tables naturally (not as afterthoughts).  

6. **Mandatory Blocks.**  
   - 11 core sections (The Why → The What → … → Retention Hook).  
   - 🧩 Cognitive Lenses block (5 lenses).  
   - ⚔ Supplementary Outcomes block (practice problems, interview Q&A, misconceptions, advanced concepts, external resources).  

7. **Coverage Requirements.**  
   - Section 2 must list ALL core concepts/variations/operations for that topic day.  
   - Section 6 must name 5-10 specific real systems (OS, DB, network, applications, cloud).  
   - Practice problems: 8-10 (real sources, no solutions).  
   - Interview questions: 6+ with follow-ups (no solutions).  
   - Misconceptions: 3-5 (with stated misconceptions, why plausible, correction, memory aid, impact).  
   - Advanced concepts: 3-5.  
   - External resources: 3-5.  

8. **Word Count Target.**  
   - 7,500-15,000 words per instructional file.  
   - No per-section quotas; use as much space as needed for clarity and depth.
"""

also refer this updated context
"""
1. avoid topic/concept related short names or abbreviations
2. keep clarity of topics in mind, use easily understandable languages whenever possible
3. try to use visual representation (Graphs, charts, flow diagram, sequence diagrams, ASCII diagrams, trace tables, or simple Mermaid flows) to explain concepts/topics rather than explaining with words, whenever it is possible, helps in understanding and remembering.
4. use mermaid diagrams or ASCII diagrams fro visual representation, use best one which is suitable
5. while generating files use file name as per conventions for example **Week_01_Day_1_RAM_Model_And_Pointers_Instructional.md**.
6. Update context to always provide output as downloadable md file.
7. For mermaid diagrams, use modern mermaid context and correct code , verify rendering
8. strictly **No LaTeX.** symbols or codes, keep things with markdown compatible
