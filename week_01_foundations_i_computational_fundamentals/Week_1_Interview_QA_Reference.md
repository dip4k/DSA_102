# 🎙 WEEK 1 — INTERVIEW QUESTION BANK

**Purpose:** Consolidated questions covering Week 1 topics  
**Format:** Questions only (No answers—practice explaining out loud)

---

## 🔹 RAM Model & Pointers (Day 1)

1. What is the RAM Model of computation?
2. Why are arrays O(1) for random access but linked lists are O(n)?
3. Explain what a pointer is in terms of hardware.
4. What is a memory leak and how does it relate to pointers?
5. How does virtual memory affect the "RAM as array" model?
6. Why is pointer arithmetic faster than array index bounds checking?

## 🔹 Asymptotic Analysis (Day 2)

7. Define Big-O notation. What does O(n²) mean?
8. What is the difference between O(n) and Θ(n)?
9. Why do we drop constants and lower-order terms in Big-O?

## 🔹 Recursion I (Day 4)

23. What are the two mandatory parts of a recursive function?

25. Why does naive Fibonacci have exponential time complexity?
26. What is the difference between pre-order and post-order recursion?
27. How does the call stack work during recursion?
28. Can every recursive function be converted to an iterative one?

## 🔹 Recursion II & Memoization (Day 5)

31. What is memoization? How does it differ from tabulation?
32. Explain overlapping subproblems with an example.
33. Why does memoization turn Fibonacci from O(2^n) to O(n)?
34. What is Tail Recursion? Why is it special?
35. Does C# support Tail Call Optimization? What about Python?
36. Can you memoize a function that reads from a database? Why or why not?
37. What is Mutual Recursion? Give an example.
38. How do you handle memoization for functions with multiple arguments?
39. What are the space trade-offs of memoization vs iteration?
40. Explain the Y-Combinator (Advanced).

## 🧩 Cross-Topic Integration Questions

41. How does the RAM Model relate to analyzing space complexity?
42. Why is Big-O analysis insufficient for embedded systems?
43. Compare iterative and recursive solutions for factorial in terms of time and space.
44. How does memoization change the "shape" of a recursion tree?
45. When would you prefer iteration over memoized recursion?

## 🎯 Usage Suggestions

- **Mock Interviews:** Have a friend ask these questions. Explain out loud.
- **Self-Recording:** Record yourself answering. Listen back for clarity.
- **Whiteboard Practice:** Draw diagrams for questions 1, 15, 23, 27, 44.
