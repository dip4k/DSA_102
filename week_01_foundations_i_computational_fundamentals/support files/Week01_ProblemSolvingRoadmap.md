## 🚫 Seven Common Problem-Solving Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Underestimating Impact of Constants

**Problem:** "O(n log n) is obviously better than O(n²)"

**Reality:** For n=100, O(n²) = 10,000 ops, O(n log n) ≈ 650 ops. For n=1000, O(n²) = 10^6, O(n log n) ≈ 10,000. But with different constants, curves cross!

**Fix:** Calculate actual operations for realistic input sizes.

---

### Pitfall 2: Assuming Virtual Memory is Free

**Problem:** "I don't need to think about page faults"

**Reality:** Page fault = 10ms disk I/O. Accessing one page-fault can cost as much as 1 million CPU cycles!

**Fix:** Understand contiguous memory, TLB behavior, working set.

---

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Cache Behavior in Algorithm Design

**Problem:** "Array and linked list are both O(n), so they're equivalent"

**Reality:** Array: cache-friendly, prefetch, 10-100x faster. Linked list: pointer chasing, TLB misses, terrible.

**Fix:** Constants matter. Understand cache lines and spatial locality.

---

### Pitfall 4: Recursion Without Understanding Limits

**Problem:** "I'll just make it recursive; it's elegant"

**Reality:** Stack overflow at ~10,000 calls. Deep recursion on large problem fails.

**Fix:** Test with realistic input sizes. Understand stack limits.

---

### Pitfall 5: Not Recognizing Overlapping Subproblems

**Problem:** "Memoization didn't help my recursive function"

**Reality:** Memoization only helps if subproblems overlap. Tree traversal has no overlap.

**Fix:** Check for repeated subproblems before memoizing.

---

### Pitfall 6: Peak Finding Panic

**Problem:** "I can't think of a better solution than O(n) scan"

**Reality:** Exploit structure: divide-conquer, check neighbors, recurse on larger side.

**Fix:** Practice peak finding. Recognize the pattern in other problems.

---

### Pitfall 7: Not Connecting Theory to Systems

**Problem:** "This is all theoretical; real systems are different"

**Reality:** Real systems follow the theory. Virtual memory, caches, TLB all matter.

**Fix:** Understand WHY theory matters. Run experiments on your system.

## 🔄 Algorithm Selection Decision Matrix

```
Choosing the Right Approach:

Problem involves search in structure?
├─ Sorted array? → Binary search (O(log n))
├─ Graph? → BFS/DFS
├─ Tree? → Tree traversal + structure
└─ Unsorted? → Scan (O(n))

Recursive structure possible?
├─ Overlapping subproblems? → Memoization
├─ Divide-and-conquer? → Split and combine
├─ No overlap? → Direct recursion OK
└─ Depth concern? → Convert to iteration

Optimize further?
├─ Can exploit monotonicity? → Binary search or similar
├─ Can divide and conquer? → Reduce complexity class
└─ Can precompute? → Trade space for speed
```
