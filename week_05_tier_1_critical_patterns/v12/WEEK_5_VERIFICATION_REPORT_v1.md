## 🎓 PEDAGOGICAL ASSESSMENT NEEDED

You should now verify using **Gate 6: Pedagogical Verification (20-30 min)**

Score each section 1(weak) 2(okay) 3(good) 4(excellent):

```
Day 1 (Hash):
☐ Engineering problem feels REAL? (not generic) [1-4]
☐ Analogy vivid and concrete? [1-4]
☐ Mechanics clear from traces? [1-4]
☐ Failures feel authentic? [1-4]
☐ Integration to Week 6 shown? [1-4]
Subtotal Day 1: ___/20

Day 2 (Monotonic):
[Same scoring]
Subtotal Day 2: ___/20

Day 3 (Intervals):
[Same scoring]
Subtotal Day 3: ___/20

Day 4 (Kadane):
[Same scoring]
Subtotal Day 4: ___/20

Day 5 (Fast-Slow):
[Same scoring]
Subtotal Day 5: ___/20

TOTAL: ___/100
Convert to /32 scale: (Total/100) × 32 = ___/32

28-32: ✅ EXCELLENT
24-27: ⚠️ GOOD
<24: ❌ NEEDS WORK
```

---

## 🎯 AUTHENTICITY CHECK (GATE 7)

After reading Week 5, could YOU:

☐ **Solve a hard LeetCode problem** with these concepts?
☐ **Explain each pattern** to someone else?
☐ **Know when to use** each pattern (not others)?
☐ **Feel like someone taught you** (not just presented)?

**Score: ___/4**

3-4: ✅ EXCELLENT TEACHING  
2: ⚠️ WEAK TEACHING  
<2: ❌ NOT TEACHING

## 📝 YOUR NEXT STEPS

### **Step 1: Read the playbook [179]**
Take 30 minutes to read through all 5 days.

### **Step 2: Pedagogical Verification (20-30 min)**
Score each day using gate 6 criteria above.

### **Step 3: Authenticity Check (10 min)**
Answer the 4 questions honestly.

### **Step 4: Final Decision**

**If scores are:**
- Pedagogical 28-32 + Authenticity 3-4 → ✅ **DEPLOY AS-IS**
- Pedagogical 24-27 + Authenticity 3-4 → ⚠️ **DEPLOY WITH MINOR NOTES**
- Anything else → ❌ **FLAG FOR REVISION** (send feedback)
