- Day 2 (Stack): "Invariants enable amortized efficiency"
- Day 3 (Intervals): "Sort then merge is all you need"
- Day 4A (Partition): "Maintain regions without sorting"
- Day 4B (Kadane): "Track optimal ending, decide extend or restart"
- Day 5 (Pointers): "Two speeds, one circle, inevitable collision"

### Weekly Retention (30 min)
- Monday after: Review all 6 retention hooks (5 min)
- Thursday after: Quiz yourself on pattern differences (15 min)
- Friday after: Teach someone about Week 05 patterns (10 min)

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (When to Slow Down)

If you can't do this → Revisit that section:

1. **Can't implement operation without reference**
   → Re-read Chapter 3 mechanics section
   → Trace through example again
   → Reimplement from trace table

2. **Can't solve easy problem in 10 minutes**
   → Pattern isn't internalized
   → Work through problem explanation
   → Code multiple variants of same problem

3. **Can't explain trade-off when asked**
   → Revisit Chapter 4 (performance) + Chapter 5 (lenses)
   → Discuss with study partner
   → Write explanation yourself

4. **Can't recognize pattern in novel problem**
   → Mix practice problems from different patterns
   → Create your own variations
   → Study 5-10 additional problems

5. **Getting frustrated or burnt out**
   → Take 2 hour break
   → Review retention hooks (quick morale boost)
   → Switch to easier problems
   → Discuss with mentor/partner

## 🎓 EXTENSION ACTIVITIES (Optional)

### After Pattern Mastery
- **Code optimization:** Implement each operation in 3 different ways, benchmark
- **Variant exploration:** Solve 5 related problems beyond the 8
- **Teaching:** Explain pattern to peer/colleague
- **System design:** Design how to use pattern at scale (millions of queries)
- **Synthesis:** Create composite problem combining 2-3 patterns

### For Advanced Learners
- Research paper: Read academic paper on one pattern
- Contribution: Add optimization to open-source library using pattern
- Interview: Conduct mock interview focusing on Week 05 patterns
- Teaching: Create video explanation for one pattern
