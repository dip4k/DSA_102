### Why Hash Patterns Matter

Hash-based lookups are the gateway to O(1) average-case performance. In Week 05, we're not building hash tables from scratch—we already understand their mechanics from Week 3. Now we leverage them as tools to solve families of problems: finding complements, counting frequencies, detecting duplicates, and grouping similar items.

Think of a hash map like a **fast filing cabinet**. You can retrieve any document in constant time if you know its label. The key insight isn't how filing cabinets work mechanically; it's *how to use them strategically* to solve problems efficiently.

---

## Pattern 1.1: Two-Sum & Complement Lookup

### Concept

The complement pattern asks: "Given a target, find two elements that sum to it." Using a hash set, we can reduce this from O(n²) brute force to O(n) single-pass.

**Core Idea:** As we iterate through the array, we ask: "Have I seen the complement of this element already?" If yes, we've found our pair.

### Visual 1: Two-Sum Execution Trace

```
Array: [2, 7, 11, 15], Target: 9

STATE 1: i=0, num=2
  ├─ Complement needed: 9 - 2 = 7
  ├─ Seen set: {}
  ├─ Found? No
  └─ Add 2 to seen: {2}

STATE 2: i=1, num=7
  ├─ Complement needed: 9 - 7 = 2
  ├─ Seen set: {2}
  ├─ Found? YES! (2 is in seen)
  └─ Return indices: [0, 1]

RESULT: Pair found at one pass, O(1) lookup per element
```

### Visual 2: Hash Map Population Pattern

```
Finding All Pairs Sum to Target = 6
Input: [3, 2, 4, 1, 5]

HASH MAP BUILD (left-to-right):
  After 3:  seen = {3}
  After 2:  seen = {3, 2}, found (4,2), check: 4+2=6 ✓
  After 4:  seen = {3, 2, 4}, pair found
  After 1:  seen = {3, 2, 4, 1}, check 1: need 5, not here yet
  After 5:  seen = {3, 2, 4, 1, 5}, found (1,5), check: 1+5=6 ✓

PAIRS: [3,3] (not valid), [2,4], [1,5]
COMPLEXITY: O(n) time, O(n) space
```

### Why This Works

The hash set acts as a **temporal filter**. By checking "have I seen this complement?" we're asking "did we encounter a compatible element earlier in the array?" This single-pass approach transforms a nested loop into sequential lookups.

**Key Invariant:** At position i, the seen set contains all elements from indices 0 to i-1. We never look ahead, only backward.

### Common Failure Modes: Day 1

#### Failure 1.1: Duplicate Element Pair

```
WRONG:
  Array: [3, 2, 4], Target: 6
  At i=0, num=3, complement=3
  ├─ Check: is 3 in seen? No (it's the current element)
  └─ Solution WRONG: Can't pair element with itself (unless allowed)

CORRECT:
  ├─ Add to seen AFTER checking, not before
  ├─ For exact duplicates, count occurrences
  ├─ Only pair if we have 2+ of the same element
  └─ Track: frequency[target/2] >= 2

LESSON: Temporal order matters. Check first, add second.
```

#### Failure 1.2: Floating-Point or Integer Overflow

```
WRONG:
  Target = 2^31 - 1, complement = target - num
  ├─ If num is large and negative, complement overflows
  └─ Hash lookup fails silently (hash(overflow) ≠ hash(real_value))

CORRECT:
  ├─ Validate complement is in valid range before lookup
  ├─ Use integer types matching your constraint
  ├─ For floating-point, use range tolerance (±epsilon)
  └─ Document assumptions about value ranges

LESSON: Edge cases hide in numeric boundaries, not logic.
```

#### Failure 1.3: Off-by-One in Duplicate Checking

```
WRONG:
  Array: [5, 5, 5], Target: 10
  Using single pass with seen set:
  ├─ i=0: 5, complement=5, not in seen, add 5 → seen={5}
  ├─ i=1: 5, complement=5, found in seen! Add indices [0,1]
  ├─ i=2: 5, complement=5, found in seen! Add indices [0,2] or [1,2]?
  └─ Returns multiple pairs (ambiguous)

CORRECT:
  ├─ If only one pair needed, return on first match
  ├─ If all pairs needed, track index pairs, not just values
  ├─ Use a frequency map: {value: count}
  └─ Check: if value==target/2, need count >= 2

LESSON: Duplicate handling requires clear requirements upfront.
```

---

## Pattern 1.2: Frequency Counting & Anagrams

### Concept

Many problems boil down to "do these collections have the same elements with the same frequencies?" Frequency maps answer this instantly.

**Core Idea:** Build a frequency map for each string/array, then compare. Hash this way: O(n) to build, O(26) for strings (assuming lowercase English).

### Visual 1: Anagram Detection via Frequency Maps

```
String1: "listen"  |  String2: "silent"

FREQUENCY MAP 1:
  'l': 1
  'i': 1
  's': 1
  't': 1
  'e': 1
  'n': 1

FREQUENCY MAP 2:
  's': 1
  'i': 1
  'l': 1
  'e': 1
  'n': 1
  't': 1

COMPARISON: Maps are identical → ANAGRAMS ✓

COMPLEXITY: O(n) build + O(26) compare = O(n)
```

### Visual 2: Top-K Frequent Elements

```
Array: [1,1,1,2,2,3], k=2

FREQUENCY COUNT:
  1 → 3 occurrences
  2 → 2 occurrences
  3 → 1 occurrence

SORT BY FREQUENCY (descending):
  [1(3), 2(2), 3(1)]

TAKE TOP K:
  Top 2: [1, 2]

OPTIMIZATION PATH:
  ├─ Naive: Hash + sort → O(n log n)
  ├─ Better: Hash + min-heap(k) → O(n log k)
  └─ Best case: Hash + bucket sort → O(n) when k small
```

---

## Quiz Questions: Day 1

**Q1: Two-Sum Variant**
Given an array of integers and a target sum, return all unique pairs (not indices). Why might using a set instead of returning indices complicate things? What would you store in the hash map instead?

**Q2: Frequency Counting Edge Case**
If you're counting character frequencies to solve "rearrange string with character spacing," why is a hash map better than sorting? What would sorting cost vs. hashing?

**Q3: Interview Scenario**
You're asked: "Find all anagrams in a list of words." Would you build one frequency map per word, or one global map? Sketch the tradeoff.

```

### Why Monotonic Stacks Exist

Many problems ask: "For each element, find the next/previous element matching some property." Brute force is O(n²): for each element, scan left and right. A **monotonic stack** reduces this to O(n) by processing elements in a single pass, maintaining a stack where elements follow a strict order (increasing or decreasing).

Think of a **monotonic stack like a height chart where you're looking for the next taller building to your right.** As you walk left-to-right, you compare each building to the stack of previous buildings you remember. The moment you find one taller, you pop shorter buildings (you know you won't need them) and record the taller one.

---

## Pattern 2.1: Next Greater Element

### Concept

Given an array, for each element, find the **next element to its right that is strictly greater**. Brute force is O(n²); monotonic stack achieves O(n).

**Key Insight:** Use a **decreasing stack**. When you encounter an element greater than the stack top, you've found the next greater for all popped elements.

### Visual 1: Decreasing Stack Execution

```
Array: [2, 1, 2, 4, 3]

STEP 1: Process 2
  ├─ Stack: [2]
  ├─ Result: {}
  └─ (No comparison yet, stack empty after 2)

STEP 2: Process 1
  ├─ 1 < 2? Yes
  ├─ Stack: [2, 1]
  ├─ Result: {}
  └─ (1 doesn't pop anything)

STEP 3: Process 2
  ├─ 2 < 1? No, 2 > 1
  ├─ Pop 1, record: next_greater[1] = 2
  ├─ Compare 2 with 2? No, equal (we want strictly greater)
  ├─ Stack: [2, 2]
  ├─ Result: {1: 2}
  └─ (Both 2s in stack now)

STEP 4: Process 4
  ├─ 4 > 2? Yes
  ├─ Pop 2, record: next_greater[2] = 4
  ├─ 4 > 2? Yes (first 2)
  ├─ Pop 2, record: next_greater[0] = 4
  ├─ Stack: [4]
  ├─ Result: {0: 4, 2: 4, 1: 2}
  └─ (All smaller elements found their answer)

STEP 5: Process 3
  ├─ 3 < 4? Yes
  ├─ Stack: [4, 3]
  ├─ Result: {0: 4, 2: 4, 1: 2}
  └─ (3 doesn't pop 4)

END: Stack [4, 3] → no right neighbors greater, result: -1
  Final: [4, 2, 4, -1, -1]

COMPLEXITY: O(n) — each element pushed/popped once
```

### Visual 2: Stack State Transitions

```
Tracking what's in the stack at each moment:

       |   |           |   |           |   |
       | 4 |           | 4 |           | 4 |
  | 2 ||   | → | 2, 1 | → | 2, 1, 2 | → | |  → | 4, 3 |
  -----       --------     ---------     ---     ---------
   [2]        [2,1]        [2,1,2]       [4]     [4,3]

KEY: When new element > stack.top(), we pop and record
```

---

## Pattern 2.2: Stock Span Problem

### Concept

Given stock prices, for each day find the **maximum span**—the longest contiguous span of days where the current price is >= all previous prices in that span.

**Why It's Tricky:** You can't just count backwards linearly. If day i has price 100 and day i-1 has price 50, the span isn't just 2; it's 2 plus whatever span day i-1 had.

**Monotonic Stack Solution:** Use a **decreasing stack of (price, span) pairs**. When you see a higher price, you "absorb" the spans of lower prices.

### Visual 1: Stock Span Calculation

```
Prices: [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]
          [0]  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  [6]  (indices)

DAY 0: price=100
  ├─ Stack: [(100, 1)]
  ├─ Span[0] = 1 (only itself)
  └─ (Nothing before day 0)

DAY 1: price=80
  ├─ 80 < 100? Yes
  ├─ Push (80, 1)
  ├─ Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1)]
  ├─ Span[1] = 1 (80 < 100 to its left)
  └─ (Can't extend backward past 100)

DAY 2: price=60
  ├─ 60 < 80? Yes
  ├─ Push (60, 1)
  ├─ Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (60, 1)]
  ├─ Span[2] = 1
  └─ (Can't extend anywhere)

DAY 3: price=70
  ├─ 70 > 60? Yes
  ├─ Pop (60, 1), absorb span: span[3] = 1 (current) + 1 (from 60) = 2
  ├─ 70 < 80? Yes
  ├─ Push (70, 2)
  ├─ Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (70, 2)]
  ├─ Span[3] = 2 (days 2 and 3)
  └─ (We skipped day 2 by absorbing its span)

DAY 4: price=60
  ├─ 60 < 70? Yes
  ├─ Push (60, 1)
  ├─ Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (70, 2), (60, 1)]
  ├─ Span[4] = 1
  └─ (Immediately drops below 70)

DAY 5: price=75
  ├─ 75 > 60? Yes
  ├─ Pop (60, 1), absorb: span[5] = 1 + 1 = 2
  ├─ 75 < 70? No, 75 > 70
  ├─ Pop (70, 2), absorb: span[5] = 2 + 2 = 4
  ├─ 75 < 80? Yes
  ├─ Push (75, 4)
  ├─ Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (75, 4)]
  ├─ Span[5] = 4 (days 2, 3, 4, 5)
  └─ (We absorbed both 70 and 60)

DAY 6: price=85
  ├─ 85 > 75? Yes
  ├─ Pop (75, 4), absorb: span[6] = 1 + 4 = 5
  ├─ 85 > 80? Yes
  ├─ Pop (80, 1), absorb: span[6] = 5 + 1 = 6
  ├─ 85 < 100? Yes
  ├─ Push (85, 6)
  ├─ Stack: [(100, 1), (85, 6)]
  ├─ Span[6] = 6 (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  └─ (Everything except day 0)

RESULT: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
```

### Why Span Absorption Works

By storing **(price, span)** pairs in the stack, we compress the history. When we pop an element due to a larger price, we "inherit" its span—we now represent a longer history than our individual position alone. This is why we add spans when absorbing.

---

## Quiz Questions: Day 2

**Q1: Decreasing vs. Increasing Stack**
For "next smaller element (to the right)," would you use a decreasing or increasing stack? Why?

**Q2: Stock Span Edge Case**
If every day's price strictly increases, what would the span array look like? Why? What about strictly decreasing?

**Q3: Circular Array Variant**
If the prices wrapped around (circular), how would you modify the monotonic stack approach? What would you iterate through twice?

```

### Why Interval Problems?

Many real-world problems are about **time windows**: meetings on a calendar, job scheduling, network packet windows. The key insight is **sorting enables single-pass merging**. Once sorted by start time, you can merge in O(n).

Think of intervals like **overlapping time blocks on a calendar**. If two meetings overlap, you can't attend both. Merging them creates a single larger block. Sorting by start time ensures you process chronologically, never missing an overlap.

---

## Pattern 3.1: Merge Overlapping Intervals

### Concept

Given intervals, merge all overlapping ones. Example: `[[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]` → `[[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]`.

**Algorithm:** Sort by start time. Iterate through; if current start overlaps with last merged interval's end, extend the end. Otherwise, add new interval.

### Visual 1: Merge Process

```
Input: [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

STEP 1: Sort by start
  ├─ Already sorted: [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
  └─ (If unsorted, sort first)

STEP 2: Initialize result with first interval
  ├─ merged = [[1,3]]
  └─ last_end = 3

STEP 3: Process [2,6]
  ├─ current_start = 2, current_end = 6
  ├─ 2 <= 3 (overlaps with last_end)?
  ├─ Yes → extend: last_end = max(3, 6) = 6
  ├─ merged = [[1,6]]
  └─ (Merge by replacing last interval)

STEP 4: Process [8,10]
  ├─ current_start = 8, current_end = 10
  ├─ 8 <= 6 (overlaps)?
  ├─ No → add new interval
  ├─ merged = [[1,6], [8,10]]
  └─ last_end = 10

STEP 5: Process [15,18]
  ├─ current_start = 15, current_end = 18
  ├─ 15 <= 10 (overlaps)?
  ├─ No → add new interval
  ├─ merged = [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
  └─ last_end = 18

OUTPUT: [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
COMPLEXITY: O(n log n) sort + O(n) merge = O(n log n)
```

### Visual 2: Overlap Detection Logic

```
Two intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] overlap if:

CONDITION 1: a2 <= b1
  ├─ [1,3] and [2,6]: 2 <= 3? Yes → OVERLAP
  ├─ [1,3] and [4,5]: 4 <= 3? No → NO OVERLAP
  └─ [1,3] and [3,5]: 3 <= 3? Yes → OVERLAP (touching)

MERGE RESULT: [a1, max(b1, b2)]
  ├─ [1,3] + [2,6] = [1, max(3,6)] = [1,6]
  └─ [1,3] + [3,5] = [1, max(3,5)] = [1,5]

KEY: current_start <= last_end means overlap
```

---

## Pattern 3.2: Insert Interval

### Concept

Given non-overlapping sorted intervals and a new interval, insert it and merge overlaps. This is trickier than merging all intervals because you're inserting one specific interval.

**Insight:** You can have three phases: (1) intervals completely before new one, (2) overlapping intervals, (3) intervals completely after. Only phase 2 merges.

### Visual 1: Insert and Merge Execution

```
Existing (sorted, non-overlapping): [[1,2], [3,5], [6,9]]
New interval: [4,8]

PHASE 1: Add all intervals ending before new start
  ├─ [1,2]: 2 < 4 (new start)? Yes → Add to result
  ├─ Result so far: [[1,2]]
  ├─ [3,5]: 5 < 4? No → Stop phase 1

PHASE 2: Merge overlapping intervals with new one
  ├─ Merge [3,5] with [4,8]
  │  ├─ Overlap check: 4 <= 5? Yes
  │  ├─ New merged: [3, max(5,8)] = [3,8]
  ├─ Check [6,9] with [3,8]
  │  ├─ Overlap check: 6 <= 8? Yes
  │  ├─ Merge: [3, max(8,9)] = [3,9]
  ├─ No more intervals to process
  └─ Add merged result: [[1,2], [3,9]]

PHASE 3: Add remaining intervals (none in this case)

OUTPUT: [[1,2], [3,9]]
COMPLEXITY: O(n) single pass, no sorting needed
```

---

## Pattern 3.3: Meeting Rooms

### Concept

Given meeting intervals, determine if one person can attend all of them (no overlap). Extension: how many rooms are needed?

**Single Person (Meeting Rooms I):** Sort by start; if any interval starts before previous ends, conflict exists.

**Multiple People (Meeting Rooms II):** At any point, count overlapping meetings. Peak overlap = rooms needed.

### Visual 1: Overlapping Count (Room Allocation)

```
Meetings: [[0,30], [5,10], [15,20]]

TIMELINE APPROACH (sweep line):
  ├─ Event at 0: person enters (start)
  ├─ Event at 5: person enters (start)
  ├─ Event at 10: person leaves (end)
  ├─ Event at 15: person enters (start)
  ├─ Event at 20: person leaves (end)
  ├─ Event at 30: person leaves (end)

SORTED EVENTS (start before end at same time):
  ├─ 0 (start) → count = 1
  ├─ 5 (start) → count = 2
  ├─ 10 (end) → count = 1
  ├─ 15 (start) → count = 2
  ├─ 20 (end) → count = 1
  ├─ 30 (end) → count = 0

MAX COUNT: 2 rooms needed

COMPLEXITY: O(n log n) sort + O(n) count = O(n log n)
```

---

## Common Failure Modes: Day 3

#### Failure 3.1: Off-by-One in Overlap Detection

```
WRONG:
  Intervals [1,3] and [3,5]
  Overlap check: 3 < 3? No → treat as non-overlapping
  Result: [[1,3], [3,5]] (wrong, they touch at 3)

CORRECT:
  Overlap check: 3 <= 3? Yes → they overlap
  Merge: [1, max(3,5)] = [1,5]
  Result: [[1,5]]

LESSON: Use <= not < for overlap detection (inclusive endpoints)
```

#### Failure 3.2: Forgetting to Sort

```
WRONG:
  Input: [[2,3], [0,1], [1,2]]
  Assume already sorted, merge directly
  └─ Would miss merging [0,1] and [1,2]

CORRECT:
  Sort first: [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3]]
  Then merge: [[0,3]]

LESSON: Always sort intervals by start time first
```

#### Failure 3.3: Adjacent Intervals Confusion

```
WRONG:
  [1,2] and [2,3]
  Thought: Adjacent but non-overlapping
  Result: Keep separate

CORRECT:
  [1,2] and [2,3]: check 2 <= 2 → Yes, overlap
  Merge: [1, max(2,3)] = [1,3]
  (Whether you merge depends on problem spec: closed vs open intervals)

LESSON: Clarify: are endpoints inclusive or exclusive?
```

## Quiz Questions: Day 3

**Q1: Merge K Sorted Lists**
You have k sorted linked lists. Merging them pairwise is naive. Why might a heap-based approach with k elements be better? What's its complexity?

**Q2: Insert Interval**
If you're inserting an interval into existing non-overlapping intervals, why don't you need to sort? How does sorting avoidance reduce complexity?

**Q3: Meeting Rooms II**
If you have 100 meetings and 99 use room A, 1 uses room B, how many rooms are needed? Walk through your algorithm to get the right answer.

### Why Partition Matters

Partition problems ask: "Rearrange this array so that all elements satisfying property P come before those that don't." The key is **in-place reorganization with two pointers**, keeping O(1) space.

Kadane's algorithm is the **canonical dynamic programming pattern**: at each position, decide whether to start fresh or extend the previous best. It's elegant and appears across many problem variants.

---

## Pattern 4.1: Dutch National Flag (Partition into 3 Colors)

### Concept

Given an array with elements 0, 1, 2, rearrange so all 0s come first, then 1s, then 2s. Do it **in-place** in one pass.

**Three-Pointer Approach:** Maintain three regions:
- **left:** boundary between 0s and unknown
- **mid:** current position
- **right:** boundary between unknown and 2s

### Visual 1: Three-Partition Execution

```
Array: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]

Initialize:
  ├─ left = 0 (start of region for 0s)
  ├─ mid = 0 (current position)
  ├─ right = 5 (start of region for 2s, from end)
  └─ (Region of 1s is between left and right)

STEP 1: arr[0]=2
  ├─ 2 == 2? Yes → swap with right (mid=0, right=5)
  ├─ After swap: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]
  ├─ right--, but don't move mid (swapped unknown element)
  ├─ right = 4
  └─ State: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1 | 2] (right side settled)

STEP 2: arr[0]=0 (but we already processed, mid was 0)
  ├─ Actually, arr[mid=0]=0 from swap
  ├─ 0 == 0? Yes → swap with left (mid=0, left=0)
  ├─ After swap: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]
  ├─ left++, mid++
  ├─ left = 1, mid = 1
  └─ State: [0 | 0, 2, 1, 1 | 2]

STEP 3: arr[1]=0
  ├─ 0 == 0? Yes → swap with left (mid=1, left=1)
  ├─ After swap: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]
  ├─ left++, mid++
  ├─ left = 2, mid = 2
  └─ State: [0, 0 | 2, 1, 1 | 2]

STEP 4: arr[2]=2
  ├─ 2 == 2? Yes → swap with right (mid=2, right=4)
  ├─ After swap: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
  ├─ right--, don't move mid
  ├─ right = 3
  └─ State: [0, 0 | 1, 1, 2 | 2]

STEP 5: arr[2]=1
  ├─ 1 == 1? Yes (in middle region) → no swap, just move mid
  ├─ mid++
  ├─ mid = 3
  └─ State: [0, 0 | 1, 1, 2 | 2]

STEP 6: arr[3]=1
  ├─ mid=3, right=3 → mid reaches right, STOP
  └─ All elements processed

RESULT: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
COMPLEXITY: O(n) time, O(1) space (only pointers)
```

---

## Pattern 4.2: Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Sum)

### Concept

Find the **contiguous subarray with the largest sum**. Naive is O(n²); Kadane's is O(n) with a clever observation.

**Key Insight:** At each position, decide: should I extend the best subarray ending here, or start fresh? If the best sum-so-far is negative, starting fresh is better.

### Visual 1: Kadane's State Transitions

```
Array: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

Initialize:
  ├─ max_current = 0 (best ending at current position)
  ├─ max_global = -infinity (overall best)
  └─ (We'll track best subarray and its indices)

STEP 1: val=-2
  ├─ max_current = max(-2, 0 + (-2)) = max(-2, -2) = -2
  ├─ max_global = max(-inf, -2) = -2
  ├─ Current subarray: [-2]

STEP 2: val=1
  ├─ max_current = max(1, -2 + 1) = max(1, -1) = 1
  ├─ max_global = max(-2, 1) = 1
  ├─ Current subarray: [1]

STEP 3: val=-3
  ├─ max_current = max(-3, 1 + (-3)) = max(-3, -2) = -2
  ├─ max_global = 1 (unchanged)
  ├─ Current subarray: [1, -3]

STEP 4: val=4
  ├─ max_current = max(4, -2 + 4) = max(4, 2) = 4
  ├─ max_global = max(1, 4) = 4
  ├─ Current subarray: [4] (started fresh)

STEP 5: val=-1
  ├─ max_current = max(-1, 4 + (-1)) = max(-1, 3) = 3
  ├─ max_global = 4 (unchanged)
  ├─ Current subarray: [4, -1]

STEP 6: val=2
  ├─ max_current = max(2, 3 + 2) = max(2, 5) = 5
  ├─ max_global = max(4, 5) = 5
  ├─ Current subarray: [4, -1, 2]

STEP 7: val=1
  ├─ max_current = max(1, 5 + 1) = max(1, 6) = 6
  ├─ max_global = max(5, 6) = 6
  ├─ Current subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1]

STEP 8: val=-5
  ├─ max_current = max(-5, 6 + (-5)) = max(-5, 1) = 1
  ├─ max_global = 6 (unchanged)
  ├─ Current subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1, -5]

STEP 9: val=4
  ├─ max_current = max(4, 1 + 4) = max(4, 5) = 5
  ├─ max_global = 6 (unchanged)
  ├─ Current subarray: [4] (started fresh? No, extended from 1)

FINAL RESULT:
  ├─ max_global = 6
  ├─ Best subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1] at indices [3, 6]
  └─ Sum: 4 - 1 + 2 + 1 = 6

COMPLEXITY: O(n) time, O(1) space
```

### Visual 2: Decision Tree at Each Position

```
At position i with value arr[i]:

Decision: extend or restart?

                    max_current
                         |
            ______________|______________
           |                              |
      extend              OR          restart
   (max_current +                     (value
    arr[i])                            itself)
      |                                   |
      └─ Choose max of both ─────────────┘
                 |
         update max_current
                 |
         update max_global if better
```

---

## Pattern 4.3: Maximum Product Subarray (Kadane Variant)

### Concept

Like maximum sum, but with **products**. The twist: negative numbers flip signs, so you need to track both **max and min** ending at each position.

**Why Track Min?** A large negative number, when multiplied by another negative, becomes positive. So the minimum (most negative) at position i-1 might become the maximum at position i.

### Visual 1: Max & Min Product Tracking

```
Array: [2, 3, -2, 4]

Initialize:
  ├─ max_current = 0 (best product ending here)
  ├─ min_current = 0 (worst product ending here)
  └─ max_global = -infinity

STEP 1: val=2
  ├─ Choices: 2 (restart), 0*2=0 (extend), 0*2=0 (extend min)
  ├─ max_current = max(2, 0, 0) = 2
  ├─ min_current = min(2, 0, 0) = 0
  ├─ max_global = 2

STEP 2: val=3
  ├─ Choices: 3 (restart), max(2)*3=6 (extend max), min(0)*3=0 (extend min)
  ├─ max_current = max(3, 6, 0) = 6
  ├─ min_current = min(3, 6, 0) = 0
  ├─ max_global = 6

STEP 3: val=-2
  ├─ KEY: min_current is 0, which when multiplied by -2 gives 0
  ├─ But max_current is 6, which when multiplied by -2 gives -12
  ├─ Choices: -2 (restart), 6*(-2)=-12, 0*(-2)=0
  ├─ max_current = max(-2, -12, 0) = 0
  ├─ min_current = min(-2, -12, 0) = -12
  ├─ max_global = 6 (unchanged)

STEP 4: val=4
  ├─ max_current is 0, min_current is -12
  ├─ Choices: 4, 0*4=0, (-12)*4=-48
  ├─ max_current = max(4, 0, -48) = 4
  ├─ min_current = min(4, 0, -48) = -48
  ├─ max_global = 6 (unchanged)

RESULT:
  ├─ max_global = 6
  ├─ Best subarray: [2, 3]
  └─ Product: 2 * 3 = 6

COMPLEXITY: O(n) time, O(1) space
```

---

## Common Failure Modes: Day 4

#### Failure 4.1: Kadane With All Negatives

```
WRONG:
  Array: [-5, -2, -8]
  max_current = -infinity initially
  At each step, max_current becomes more negative
  ├─ max_current = -5 → -2 (wait, max(-5, 0 + (-2))?)
  └─ This breaks if we don't initialize correctly

CORRECT:
  Initialize max_current = arr[0] (first element)
  Then update from index 1
  ├─ max_current = -5
  ├─ i=1: max_current = max(-2, -5 + (-2)) = max(-2, -7) = -2
  ├─ i=2: max_current = max(-8, -2 + (-8)) = max(-8, -10) = -8
  ├─ max_global = -2 (best single element: -2)

LESSON: Kadane must initialize with first element or handle negatives
```

#### Failure 4.2: Three-Partition Pointer Confusion

```
WRONG:
  Moving mid after any swap:
  ├─ arr[mid] = 2, swap with right
  ├─ After swap, we moved mid without knowing what came from right
  └─ The new arr[mid] is unknown, can't classify it yet

CORRECT:
  ├─ arr[mid] = 0 → swap left, move mid (we put a 0 in correct spot)
  ├─ arr[mid] = 1 → no swap, just move mid (1 is in correct region)
  ├─ arr[mid] = 2 → swap right, DON'T move mid (unknown came from right)

LESSON: Only move mid when you've classified the element or region
```

#### Failure 4.3: Circular Subarray in Kadane

```
WRONG:
  Circular array: [3, -1, 2, -1, 3]
  Kadane finds [3, -1, 2] = 4
  But wrapping [3] + [3] = 6 is better
  Standard Kadane misses this

CORRECT (Option 1 - Two Pass):
  ├─ Find max subarray sum (standard)
  ├─ Find min subarray sum (Kadane with min)
  ├─ Circular max = total_sum - min_sum
  └─ Return max(max_linear, max_circular)

CORRECT (Option 2 - Try Both Ends):
  ├─ Extend from start and end
  ├─ Track carefully to avoid double-counting

LESSON: Circular variants need special handling
```

## Quiz Questions: Day 4

**Q1: Partition with 4 Colors**
You have an array with colors 0, 1, 2, 3. Can you generalize the three-pointer approach to four pointers? What would each pointer represent?

**Q2: Maximum Product Subarray With Zeros**
If your array contains 0, how does it affect the product-based Kadane? Why is 0 a "reset" point?

**Q3: Cyclic Sort Use Case**
You're given integers 1 to n with one missing and one duplicate. Why is cyclic sort O(n) when sorting is O(n log n)? How does position-based rearrangement help?

### Why Fast-Slow Pointers?

Many problems involve **finding cycles or midpoints in sequences**. The elegant observation is: if you move one pointer twice as fast as another, the fast pointer will "lap" the slow one exactly once in a cycle. This reduces O(n) space for marking visited nodes to O(1) space.

Think of it like **two runners on a circular track**. If one runs twice as fast, they'll meet again. The slower runner completes one lap, the faster completes two. Their meeting point has a geometric relationship to the track's structure.

---

## Pattern 5.1: Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)

### Concept

Detect if a linked list has a cycle using **O(1) space**. Two pointers: slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps. If they meet, there's a cycle.

**Why It Works:** In a cycle, the fast pointer gains 1 step per iteration on the slow pointer. Eventually, it catches up.

### Visual 1: Cycle Detection Execution

```
Linked List with Cycle:
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
         ↑       ↓
         └───────┘

STEP 1: slow=1, fast=1
  ├─ slow moves to 2
  ├─ fast moves to 3
  └─ 2 ≠ 3, continue

STEP 2: slow=2, fast=3
  ├─ slow moves to 3
  ├─ fast moves to 5
  └─ 3 ≠ 5, continue

STEP 3: slow=3, fast=5
  ├─ slow moves to 4
  ├─ fast moves to 3 (wraps: 5→4→3)
  └─ 4 ≠ 3, continue

STEP 4: slow=4, fast=3
  ├─ slow moves to 5
  ├─ fast moves to 5 (wraps: 3→4→5)
  └─ 5 = 5, CYCLE DETECTED!

RESULT: Cycle exists
COMPLEXITY: O(n) time, O(1) space
```

### Visual 2: Finding Cycle Start

```
After detecting cycle at meeting point, find the start:

List: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
             ↑       ↓
             └───────┘
         (Cycle starts at 3)

Step 1: Reset one pointer (say slow) to head (1)
  ├─ slow = 1 (back to head)
  └─ fast = meeting point (5)

Step 2: Move both at same speed (1 step each)
  ├─ Iteration 1: slow=2, fast=1 (5→1 wraps around)
  ├─ Iteration 2: slow=3, fast=2
  ├─ Iteration 3: slow=4, fast=3
  ├─ Iteration 4: slow=5, fast=4
  ├─ Iteration 5: slow=3, fast=5
  └─ Wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate...

Actually, in a linked list (not array), the fast pointer at meeting 
point needs careful tracking. The math:
  - Distance from head to cycle start: a
  - Distance from cycle start to meeting point: b
  - Remaining cycle: c
  - When they meet: slow has traveled a+b, fast has traveled a+b+kc
  - Slow pointer position: a steps into cycle
  - Moving both from meeting point at slow speed will meet at a again

Step 2 (Correct):
  ├─ slow = head (1)
  ├─ fast = meeting point
  ├─ Move both 1 step at a time
  ├─ They meet at cycle start (3)

INSIGHT: Meeting point's distance to cycle start equals
         head's distance to cycle start
```

---

## Pattern 5.2: Finding Middle of Linked List

### Concept

Find the **middle element** of a linked list (or split into two halves). Fast-slow pointers elegantly solve this without knowing the length.

**Algorithm:** Slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2. When fast reaches end, slow is at middle.

### Visual 1: Midpoint Finding

```
List: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → null

STEP 1: slow=1, fast=1
  ├─ slow moves to 2
  ├─ fast moves to 3
  └─ fast != null, continue

STEP 2: slow=2, fast=3
  ├─ slow moves to 3
  ├─ fast moves to 5
  └─ fast != null, continue

STEP 3: slow=3, fast=5
  ├─ slow moves to 4
  ├─ fast moves to null (5.next.next)
  └─ fast == null, STOP

MIDDLE: slow = 3 (middle node)

For splitting: [1, 2] and [3, 4, 5]
  ├─ Cut after slow: 1→2→null, 3→4→5→null
  └─ Perfect split for merge sort

List with Even Length: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → null

STEP 1: slow=1, fast=1
  ├─ slow → 2, fast → 3
  ├─ fast != null

STEP 2: slow=2, fast=3
  ├─ slow → 3, fast → null
  ├─ fast == null, STOP

MIDDLE: slow = 3 (first half ends at 2, second starts at 3)
```

---

## Pattern 5.3: Happy Number (Cycle Detection in Sequences)

### Concept

A "happy number" follows this rule: repeatedly sum the squares of its digits until you get 1 (happy) or enter a cycle (unhappy).

Example: 19 → 1²+9² = 82 → 8²+2² = 68 → ... → eventually 1 (happy)

**Fast-Slow Solution:** Use Floyd's algorithm on the digit-square-sum sequence!

### Visual 1: Happy Number Detection

```
Number: 19

Step 1: n=19, digits 1,9
  ├─ slow = 19
  ├─ fast = 19
  └─ sum = 1² + 9² = 82

Step 2: 
  ├─ slow_next(19) = 82
  ├─ fast_next(19) = 1² + 9² = 82
  ├─ fast_next(82) = 8² + 2² = 68
  ├─ slow = 82, fast = 68
  └─ 82 ≠ 68

Step 3:
  ├─ slow_next(82) = 68
  ├─ fast_next(68) = 6² + 8² = 100
  ├─ fast_next(100) = 1² + 0² + 0² = 1
  ├─ slow = 68, fast = 1
  └─ 68 ≠ 1

Step 4:
  ├─ slow_next(68) = 100
  ├─ fast_next(1) = 1
  ├─ fast_next(1) = 1
  ├─ slow = 100, fast = 1
  └─ 100 ≠ 1

Step 5:
  ├─ slow_next(100) = 1
  ├─ fast already at 1
  ├─ slow = 1, fast = 1
  └─ MATCH! Slow reached 1 → HAPPY NUMBER

Alternative (if reaches cycle):
  Cycle like 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4
  Eventually fast and slow would meet at same point in cycle
  └─ Check if meeting point == 1; if not, unhappy

COMPLEXITY: O(log n) iterations, O(1) space
```

---

## Common Failure Modes: Day 5

#### Failure 5.1: Null Pointer in Fast Pointer

```
WRONG:
  while fast != null and fast.next != null:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next

  But accessing fast.next.next without checking fast.next first:
  ├─ If fast.next is null, fast.next.next will crash
  └─ Null pointer dereference error

CORRECT:
  while fast != null and fast.next != null:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next  # Now safe because checked fast.next

LESSON: Check intermediate pointers before chaining access
```

#### Failure 5.2: Incorrect Loop Condition

```
WRONG (for cycle detection):
  while slow != fast:
      ... (never checks if fast == null)
  
  If no cycle, fast reaches null first
  └─ Infinite loop or null pointer error

CORRECT:
  while fast != null and fast.next != null:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next
      if slow == fast:
          return true (cycle found)
  return false (no cycle, fast reached end)

LESSON: Loop must have escape condition besides pointer equality
```

#### Failure 5.3: Cycle Start Calculation Error

```
WRONG:
  After detecting cycle, immediately return meeting point
  ├─ Meeting point is NOT necessarily cycle start
  └─ You found a point in the cycle, not where it starts

CORRECT:
  Step 1: Detect cycle (fast/slow meet)
  Step 2: Reset slow to head
  Step 3: Move both slowly until they meet again
  Step 4: That meeting point IS the cycle start

REASON: Math! The meeting point's distance to cycle start
        equals the head's distance to cycle start

LESSON: Cycle start requires second phase of movement
```

## Quiz Questions: Day 5

**Q1: Cycle Detection Without Head Pointer**
If you have a pointer into a linked list (not the head), can you still detect a cycle using Floyd's algorithm? What changes?

**Q2: Finding K-th Node from End**
Using fast-slow pointers, how would you find the k-th node from the end of a linked list? Set up the initial gap between them first?

**Q3: Palindrome Linked List**
You have a singly linked list. Using fast-slow to find the middle, how would you check if the list is a palindrome? (Hint: reverse the second half)

## 📝 Final Note

This playbook is designed for **mastery, not memorization**. Each pattern teaches a way of thinking—a lens through which to view problems. When you encounter a new problem, ask:

- **"Do I need fast lookups?"** → Hash patterns
- **"Do I need the next/previous element by property?"** → Monotonic stack
- **"Are there overlapping ranges?"** → Interval patterns
- **"Am I optimizing a single value across positions?"** → Kadane
- **"Do I need to detect a cycle or find a midpoint?"** → Fast-slow pointers

Master these mental models, and the code becomes implementation detail.
