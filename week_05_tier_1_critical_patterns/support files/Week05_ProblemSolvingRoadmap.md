## 🎯 Overall Problem-Solving Strategy for Week 05

### Stage 1: Pattern Recognition (Foundation)
**Goal:** Solve canonical problems for each of 6 patterns  
**Time:** Days 1-2  
**Outcome:** You can identify pattern, solve on first attempt with slight hesitation

**Pattern Recognition Checklist:**
- [ ] Two-sum (hash complement)
- [ ] Next greater element (monotonic stack)
- [ ] Merge intervals (greedy interval)
- [ ] Dutch National Flag (partition)
- [ ] Maximum subarray (Kadane's)
- [ ] Cycle detection (fast-slow)

### Stage 2: Variation & Constraint (Mastery)
**Goal:** Solve 2-3 variations with new constraints per pattern  
**Time:** Days 3-4  
**Outcome:** You modify algorithm for new constraints without recoding logic

**Variations to Explore:**
- Hash: anagrams, frequency, membership, two-sum variations
- Stack: next element, stock span, rain water, histogram
- Intervals: merge, insert, k-lists, calendar scheduling
- Partition: Dutch flag, cyclic sort, find missing/duplicate
- Kadane: max sum, max product, circular, with constraints
- Fast-slow: cycle start, midpoint, palindrome, happy number

### Stage 3: Integration & System (Mastery+)
**Goal:** Solve problems combining patterns or adding system design  
**Time:** Day 5  
**Outcome:** You see multiple patterns in one problem, decide which to combine

**Integration Examples:**
- Hash + partition for duplicates
- Stack + intervals for bracket nesting
- Kadane + constraints for budgeted problems
- Fast-slow + hash for cycle value detection

## 🎯 Common Problem-Solving Pitfalls & Fixes

### Pitfall 1: Not Checking Hash Key Existence

**Problem:** KeyNotFoundException or wrong logic
```
if map[key] > 0:  # Crashes if key not present!
```

**Fix:** Always check existence first
```
if key in map and map[key] > 0:
```

---

### Pitfall 2: Forgetting Monotonic Stack Invariant

**Problem:** Stack has random elements, logic fails
```
if arr[i] > stack[-1]:  # Don't just compare, need to POP
  # Still wrong
```

**Fix:** Pop all violating elements FIRST
```
while stack and arr[i] > stack[-1]:
  pop_and_process()
stack.push(i)  # Then push new element
```

---

### Pitfall 3: Sorting Intervals Wrong

**Problem:** Sorted by end time, merging fails
```
intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # WRONG! Sort by start
```

**Fix:** Sort by start time, then merge from left to right
```
intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
```

---

### Pitfall 4: Partition with Duplicate Checks

**Problem:** Trying to swap but already at right place
```
while arr[i] != i+1:  # Infinite loop if arr[i] == arr[arr[i]-1]
  swap(i, arr[i]-1)
```

**Fix:** Check if target position already has right value
```
if arr[i] != i+1 and arr[arr[i]-1] != arr[i]:
  swap(i, arr[i]-1)
else:
  i += 1  # Skip if already correct or duplicate
```

---

### Pitfall 5: Kadane's Not Handling All Negative

**Problem:** Returns 0 instead of max negative
```
max_so_far = 0
max_ending_here = 0
for num in arr:
  max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here + num)
  max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
# Returns 0 for [-5,-2,-8]
```

**Fix:** Initialize with first element
```
max_so_far = arr[0]
max_ending_here = arr[0]
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
  ...
```

---

### Pitfall 6: Fast-Slow with No Null Check

**Problem:** Null pointer exception when fast reaches end
```
while fast and fast.next:  # What about fast.next.next?
  fast = fast.next
  slow = slow.next
```

**Fix:** Check all dereferences
```
while fast and fast.next and fast.next.next:
  fast = fast.next.next
  slow = slow.next
```

## 🔄 Pattern Decision Matrix: How to Choose

Given a problem, which pattern(s) fit?

```
Does the problem ask about:

├─ "Find pairs/elements with property"?
│  └─ Use Hash (complement lookup, frequency)
│
├─ "Next/Previous element greater/smaller"?
│  └─ Use Monotonic Stack
│
├─ "Merge overlapping ranges"?
│  └─ Use Intervals (sort + greedy)
│
├─ "Find missing/duplicate in 1..n"?
│  └─ Use Partition / Cyclic Sort
│
├─ "Maximum/minimum subarray sum"?
│  └─ Use Kadane's Algorithm
│
├─ "Linked list cycle/midpoint"?
│  └─ Use Fast-Slow Pointers
│
├─ "Combining two or more above"?
│  └─ Use integration (multiple patterns)
│
└─ "Unsure"?
   └─ Check: sorted? Space constraint? Streaming? Multiple solutions?
      └─ These hints suggest pattern family
```
