# 🎙 WEEK 2 — INTERVIEW QUESTION BANK

**Purpose:** Consolidated questions covering Week 2 topics  
**Format:** Questions only (No answers—practice explaining out loud)

## 🔹 Arrays & Dynamic Arrays (Day 1-2)

1. Why is array access O(1) in terms of hardware?
2. Explain how a Dynamic Array grows. What is the complexity?
3. Why do we typically double the capacity? Why not `+100`?
4. What is the difference between `Capacity` and `Size`?
5. How would you delete an element from an array in O(1) if order didn't matter?
6. Explain the difference between Row-Major and Column-Major order.
7. What are the pros/cons of a Jagged Array vs Multi-dimensional Array?
8. How does `ArrayList` in Java differ from `LinkedList`?

---

## 🔹 Linked Lists (Day 3)

9. Why is a Linked List insertion O(1) but Array insertion O(n)?
10. How do you find the middle of a Linked List in one pass?
11. Explain Floyd’s Cycle Detection algorithm (Tortoise & Hare).
12. Why is Binary Search inefficient on a Linked List?
13. How do you reverse a Singly Linked List? (Explain pointers).
14. What is a Sentinel Node and why is it useful?
15. How would you delete a node if you only had a pointer to *that* node (no prev)?
16. Compare Singly Linked List vs Doubly Linked List memory usage.

## 🔹 Stacks & Queues (Day 4)

17. Implement a Queue using Two Stacks. Explain the complexity.
18. Implement a Stack using Two Queues.
19. What is a Monotonic Stack? Give a use case.
20. Why do we use a Circular Buffer for Array-based Queues?
21. How does the CPU use a Stack for function calls?
22. Explain the "Min Stack" problem (getMin in O(1)).
23. What is a Deque? When would you use it?
24. How do you handle Stack Overflow in a recursive algorithm?

---

## 🔹 Binary Search (Day 5)

25. Why is the time complexity of Binary Search O(log n)?
26. Write the loop condition for Binary Search. Why `<=` vs `<`?
27. How do you find the *first* occurrence of a number in a sorted array with duplicates?
28. Explain "Binary Search on Answer".
29. How do you handle Integer Overflow when calculating `mid`?
30. Can you Binary Search a Rotated Sorted Array? How?
31. What is the difference between Lower Bound and Upper Bound?
32. Why is Linear Search sometimes faster than Binary Search?

---

## 🧩 Cross-Topic Integration Questions

33. Compare the locality of reference: Array vs Linked List.
34. Which data structure is best for implementing a browser's Back/Forward button?
35. How would you implement an Undo feature for a text editor?
36. Why are Stacks usually implemented with Dynamic Arrays instead of Linked Lists?
37. Design a data structure that supports Insert, Delete, GetRandom in O(1).
38. Explain how a Hash Map handles collisions using Linked Lists (Chaining).

## 🎯 Usage Suggestions

- **Mock Interviews:** Have a friend ask these questions. Explain out loud.
- **Self-Recording:** Record yourself answering. Listen back for clarity.
- **Whiteboard Practice:** Draw diagrams for questions 2, 11, 20, 26.
