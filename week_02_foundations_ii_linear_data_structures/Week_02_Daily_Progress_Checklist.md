- [ ] Trace finding `7` in `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
- [ ] Explain why it loops forever if `mid` calc is wrong.

### Practice
- [ ] LeetCode 704 (Binary Search)
- [ ] LeetCode 278 (First Bad Version)

---

## 🔄 Weekly Integration

### Weekend Synthesis Activity
- [ ] Build a "Cheat Sheet" comparing Array vs Linked List.
